### This is a summary of the features of my portfolio which is created from scratch in fulfilment of the Web Design for Everyone capstone project.

You can refer to my portfolio site https://caratancy.github.io/caratancy/ <br>
My site is VALIDATED - please see the documentation titled 'Validation'.<br>
My site is RESPONSIVE - there are different layouts for mobile and larger screens.  The wireframes that illustrate the responsiveness can also be found in the documentation titled 'Wireframes'.<br>
My site is STYLED - it uses what I think is a good color scheme and clear fonts.  The site contains content that most will find relevant and appealing during the recent spade of lockdowns to curb the pandemic situation..<br> 
My site has these four ENHANCEMENTS: (i) incorporated lightbox to showcase a gallery view of photos at the bottom of site (ii) used a sticky footer to create a consistent look across browser heights (iii) enhanced the accessibility of my page and you can refer to the documentation titled 'Accessibility' (iv) added hovering features to increase the user experience at the pictures found at the bottom of my site.
